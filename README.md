# Hi there!
I am Janet Mardjuki (She/Her/Hers), and I am a software developer based in Vancouver, Canada 🇨🇦. Mainly interested in full stack web development. Python 🐍 is my go-to language for daily usage, but I also enjoy writing code in C 👀, and JavaScript. Outside work, I enjoy baking 👩‍🍳 and bouldering 🧗‍♀️.
